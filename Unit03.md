**Unit 3: Risk Attitudes and Expected Utility Theory** <span
id="3"></span> 
*The previous unit introduced the most commonly used ways in which we
measure risk and uncertainty.  It is important to understand that these
measures are usually misunderstood, misused and misapplied.  Whenever we
look into risks, risk measures, and risk management, we must always view
these in a greater context. In this unit, we focus on the risk within
the “satisfaction” value maximization for individual and firms. The
value here is measured by economists by comparing levels of satisfaction
an individual achieves when confronted with two or more choices.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 10 hours to complete.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
-   Discuss the economic concept of utility theory.
-   Understand assumptions that underlie individual preferences, which
    can then be mapped onto a utility “function,” reflecting the
    satisfaction level associated with individuals’ preferences.
-   Explore how individuals maximize utility (or satisfaction).
-   Understand that an individual’s objective is to maximize expected
    utility when making decisions under uncertainty.
-   Understand that people are risk averse, risk neutral, or risk
    seeking.
