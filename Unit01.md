**Unit 1: The Nature of Risk: Losses and Opportunities** <span
id="1"></span> 
*Risk management has become a focal point in business practices and
societal decision-making in the twenty-first century.  The focus on risk
management has become particularly important with the recent crisis of
the global financial systems that arose with the failures in predicting,
preventing, and containing risk.  As a focused field of study, risk
management draws on core knowledge from law, engineering, finance,
economics, medicine, psychology, accounting, mathematics, statistics,
and other fields to create a holistic and sustainable decision-making
framework.  This unit introduces the fundamentals of risk management,
including the definition of risk and roles of risk in decision-making. 
You will also learn to distinguish between different classifications of
risks and attitudes toward risk.*
