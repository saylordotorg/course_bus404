**Unit 5: The Evolution of Risk Management: Enterprise Risk Management**
<span id="5"></span> 
*The first three units of this course provided information to help you
understand and measure risks, as well as to evaluate risk attitudes and
risk behavior. Unit 4 concentrated on risk management and methods for
identifying, measuring, and managing risks. This final unit introduces
an idea that is critical to the management of risk--the realization that
all risks should be treated in a holistic, global, and integrated
manner, as opposed to having individual divisions within a firm treating
the risk separately. Information technology, globalization, and
innovation in financial technologies have all led to a term called
“enterprise risk management” (ERM) that includes managing pure
opportunity and speculative risks. This concept of Enterprise-wide Risk
Management (ERM) was named one of the top ten breakthrough ideas in
business by the **Harvard Business Review** in 2004.*
