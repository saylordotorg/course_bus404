**Unit 4: Risk Management: Fundamental Tools** <span id="4"></span> 
*In the prior units, we discussed risks at length from a variety of
angles. With this unit, we finally begin the discussion of risk
management methods.  The first step to understanding risk management is
to learn the basics of the fundamental risk management processes.  In a
broad sense, these include the processes of identifying, assessing,
measuring, and evaluating alternative ways to mitigate risks.  
  
 Fortunately, the importance of this topic (considered by some as THE
most important) has resulted in the development of several risk
management [standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards) from
highly respected organizations such as the [Project Management
Institute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Institute),
the [National Institute of Science and
Technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Science_and_Technology),
actuarial societies, and ISO.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 17 hours to complete.

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
-   List the risk management steps.
-   Identify risks and create a risk map to communicate the importance
    of each risk on a severity and frequency grid.
-   Compute the frequency and severity of losses.
-   Conduct a cost-benefit analysis for loss control.
-   Consider alternatives available for managing risks based on the
    frequency and severity of the risks—transferring the risk, avoiding
    it, and managing it internally with loss controls.
