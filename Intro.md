Course Syllabus for "BUS404: Risk Management"
---------------------------------------------

The Business Administration major is designed to prepare you for a
leadership role in today’s highly competitive, global business
environment.  This elective course will allow you to incorporate risk
management principles into your individual management style.  Risk
management refers to the process of identifying, assessing, and
prioritizing risks.  This course will teach you how to accurately assess
the consequences of uncertain events; the ultimate goal for risk
managers is to reduce and control the likelihood of such occurrences. 
Personal attitudes toward risk vary widely (for example, attitudes can
range from risk-averse to risk-seeking).  You are advised to approach
this course from the perspective of a business manager (i.e., as a
decision maker). Unforeseen circumstances can occur in various contexts,
including natural disaster, collapses in financial markets, and
accidents.  As a business manager, you will need to use risk management
tools to minimize and control the probability and impact of unfortunate
events.  Global events from the past few years provide ample evidence of
the challenges associated with managing risk. In this course, you will
engage with case studies that address the catastrophes of the first
decade of the new millennium, including the credit crisis of 2008–2009. 
These cases illustrate the importance of risk management and demonstrate
how missed opportunities in effective risk management can and have led
to monumental negative consequences.  You will learn how and why risk
management is a primary strategy for sustainability and success in our
uncertain and complex world.

### Course Information

Welcome to BUS404: Risk Management.  Below, please find general
information on this course and its requirements.   
    
 **Course Designers: **Rick Gibson, Ph.D. and Ha Nguyen, Ph.D., MBA  
    
 **Primary Resources: **This course is composed of a variety of free,
online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of:

-   MIT Open Courseware: Professor John Parsons’ Practice of Finance:
    Advanced Corporate Risk Management: [Course
    Notes](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-997-practice-of-finance-advanced-corporate-risk-management-spring-2009/lecture-notes/)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of the assigned materials. 
The “Risk Management Reference Sheet” provided in Unit 1, along with the
templates and checklists provided throughout the course, will come in
handy as you apply the concepts introduced in each unit.  It may serve
you well to print or download these items for quick reference.  You will
also need to complete:  

-   Unit 1 Assessment
-   Unit 3 Assessment
-   Unit 4 Assessment
-   Unit 5 Assessment
-   Unit 5 Activity
-   Unit 6 Assessment
-   The Final Exam 

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the resources in the course as well as the
assessments and activity listed above.  
    
In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
**Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **74.5
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, the readings for Unit 1 should take 5 hours to
complete.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete subunits 1.1 through 1.3 (a total of 3 hours) on Monday night;
subunits 1.4 and 1.5 (a total of 2 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.  
    
**Tips/Suggestions: **If you are taking this elective, ideally you will
have completed all of the courses in the Core Program of the Business
Major, which consists of a selection of courses that focus on
cross-functional business competencies but do not cover risk
management.  
  
The companion textbook, *[Risk Management for Enterprises and
Individuals](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_risk-management-for-enterprises-and-individuals/),*
uses “links” in each chapter to tie each concept and objective in the
chapter to the realm of global or holistic management of risk.  The
solutions to risk problems require a compilation of techniques and
perspectives, often fitting together like puzzle pieces.  Each chapter
begins with a connection section to show relationships between personal
risk and holistic enterprise risk.
