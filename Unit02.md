**Unit 2: Risk Measurement and Metrics** <span id="2"></span> 
*The previous unit explained how risk arises as a consequence of
uncertainty and proposed that risk and uncertainty are connected but
distinct concepts.  This unit will discuss methods of measuring risk and
uncertainty.  In order to understand and use the concepts of risk and
uncertainty, you need to be able to measure outcomes.  All too often,
assessments of risk are mere guesses, and the consequences can range
from lost opportunities to death.*  
  
 *This unit will discuss measurable and quantifiable outcomes as well as
how you can measure risk and uncertainty using numerical methods.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 9 hours to complete.

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Use probability models to quantify the relative frequency of
    occurrences of uncertain events.
-   Identify and explain measures of frequency, severity, likelihood,
    statistical distributions, and expected values.
-   Compute common measures of risk using statistical concepts such as
    probability and frequency.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: In this assessment, you will be asked to answer
    several questions on an actuarial exam.  An actuary uses mathematics
    to quantify and to predict the financial impact of risk and
    uncertainty.  In order to become an actuary, a person has to
    complete successfully a series of professional level exams.  The
    practice exam that you will work is the basic exam, dealing with
    probability.  To prepare for this assessment, you may want to
    refresh what you have learned from your Probability and Statistics
    courses.  
        
     To access the practice exam, click on the link above.  Under the
    section titled Course P Examination: (Probability) click on the link
    “Practice Exercises for Course P Examination” to download the PDF
    file.  This is a sample exam for Exam P of Society of Actuaries. 
    The questions are on pages 1-82.  For this course, please answer
    questions 6, 14, 29, 32, 33, 36, 48, 53, 64, and 99.  After you
    complete this exam, check your answers against the solutions. You
    will notice that after the final question on page 82 the solutions
    are listed and the page numbers restart from 1-54.  
        
     This assignment will take you approximately 2 hours to complete.
